# Setup
Download all interesting osm data that you want to process (For this exercise we used the country splits of the continental european dataset from geofabrik). Tested on https://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html with all sub regions as files.

Python version: 3.13

Install requirements.txt

Install Osmium Tool https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/ (tested with version 1.16.0)

# Extracting the data
Place data in a folder named geodata (relative to the scripts) make the following scripts executable using chmod: (extract-data.sh, extract-keys.sh, extract-poi.sh, download-airbnb.py, consolidate_geojson.py) and run the extract-data.sh and wait for it to complete (this might take a while)
If you get errors when download the airbnb listings, you might need to fetch the most up to date links from https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ and replace the existing ones in the airbnb-download-links.txt, they release quarterly updates also deprecating old links.

The additional data preparation steps like cleaning the airbnb data and enriching with POI data happens in the jupyter notebook.
