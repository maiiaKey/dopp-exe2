# Setup for reproducing the PoI & Airbnb datasets used in the exercise
(Skip if using downloaded datasets)
Download all interesting osm data that you want to process (For the exercise we used the country splits of the continental european dataset from geofabrik). Tested on https://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html with all sub regions as files.

Python version: 3.13

Install requirements.txt

Install Osmium Tool https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/ (tested with version 1.16.0)

## Extracting the data
Place data in a folder named geodata (relative to the scripts) make the following scripts executable using chmod: (extract-data.sh, extract-keys.sh, extract-poi.sh, download-airbnb.py, consolidate_geojson.py) and run the extract-data.sh and wait for it to complete (this might take a while)
If you get errors when download the airbnb listings, you might need to fetch the most up to date links from https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ and replace the existing ones in the airbnb-download-links.txt, they release quarterly updates also deprecating old links.

The additional data preparation steps like cleaning the airbnb data and enriching with POI data happens in the jupyter notebook.
